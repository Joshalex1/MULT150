 Is the game too easy or hard?
It's both easy and hard because the balls are moving so fast that it's hard to
hit them and the Balls hit every goal eventually when you do nothing.

What would make it easier or harder?
Once you hit a ball with your bumper, it slows down for a few seconds, which
could make it easier to hit them and maybe adding obstacles near the goals could
prevent balls from scoring on their own.

What would give it a "wow" factor?
Once the first ball scores, the goals start to alternate positions every few
seconds.

What parts of the game are fun? What parts of the game are tedious?
Hiting the balls and watching them fly is still amusing and I'd say the chaos
balls themselves could pose more of a challenge.


Improvements:

I added a terrain so the player sees more than empty space and I made bumpers
for the goals so the balls don't just score by themselves.

I changed the players bumper a little bit.

I added some new Chaos balls.

I Changed the players footsteps sounds with a water sound effect.
