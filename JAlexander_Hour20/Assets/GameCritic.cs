Is the game too easy or hard? Give 2 unique reasons why it is easy or hard.
The obstacles are pretty easy to avoid because the phase ability has no cool down,
however, the obstacles do spawn right in front of the player so it can be challeging.



What 2 changes would you do to make it easier or harder?
I would have the obstacles spawn more clones across the map so it would be harder
to grab powerups. I would also add a cooldown to the phase ability or make the
powerups prevent you from phasing until the game time speeds up again.


List 2 things that would give it a "wow" factor.
Making the powerups move side to side could be interesting.
Mabye making the entire gauntlet rotate in different directions and adding
an evironment to show the player its rotating which could be distracting.


What 2 parts of the game are fun?
I enjoy the phase abitity mostly because of the material and moving the player
and dodging is enjoyable.


What 2 parts of the game are tedious?
The obstacles spawning in a line is pretty repetitive.
The powerups sometimes spawn right next to eachother which makes it too easy to
pick them up.

Changes I made:
Changed the obstacle to a helix and made it purple.
I made the particle system on the powerup spaz out a little by tweaking the
gravity.
